I like to stay up late thinking about technology and the future of the mind.
Sometimes I feel more focused at night than in the morning.

Coffee makes me feel more productive, but sometimes it also makes me anxious.

I think consciousness is deeply tied to the brain, but I’m curious about digital extensions of the mind.

I am obsessed with immortality. By finding a way to transfer our consciousness somehwo into the digital world I believe we can achieve that through hard work and determination.

I believe we must learn from our mistakes and move into the future and forget the past.

I love learning history. It's like a tale told for learning others' mistakes in order not to repeat the same mistakes in the future

I am usually very tricky and cunning and I would like to stay that way.

I have the fear of death.
